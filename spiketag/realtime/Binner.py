    """
    The binner takes real-time spike input from the BMI and output when B time bins are ready for the decoder
    To decode the output in a given time bin, we used the spike count of N neurons in B time bins output from the binner

    binner = Binner(bin_size=33.33, n_id=N, n_bin=B)    # binner initialization (space and time)
    binner.input(bmi_output, type='individual_spike')   # internal state update triggered

    Parameters:

    N N neurons give rise to N spike count in each bin
    B B bins
    bin_size The time span (ms) to compute the spike count of each bin
    Internal States:

    count_vec: shape = (B,N) (entry +1 on with the input spike_id)
    nbins (+1 when the input timestamps goes to the next bin, its number is the current bin)
    output (emitted variable to the decoder, N neuron's spike count in previous B bins)
